# Airtame Technical Challenge - Tic-tac-toe

This challenge consists of two questions - a programming problem and a written exercise. Submit your solutions by committing them into this git repository.

## Challenge 1

Implement tic-tac-toe for a modern browser, using tools and frameworks of your choice. Your program should satisfy the following requirements:
* design based on the mock-ups provided (the typeface is called Moon, available for free). We expect that you fill in the design details we left out to make the game aesthetically pleasing and easily usable. It is fine to make visual changes from the mock-up - just tell us why you think they're better.
* at least one transition/animation enhancing your final design.

What we're looking for:
* clean separation of game logic and UI rendering code.
* a sense for design and usability, both in visual appearance and CSS structure.
* we like to learn and be surprised, and it would delight us to see something we haven't come across before, whether that's a framework, a coding style, a trick or a design feature. Be sure to highlight what you're proud of or happy about :).

## Challenge 2

Reflect upon your solution to Challenge 1 in writing. We understand that you have limited time to implement your solution, after a long workday or instead of some nice downtime on a weekend. Now is your time to elaborate what you would have done if you had more time.

We're looking for answers to the following:
* if it was your main project, what would be your next move? What do you think is missing to your solution?
* what additional steps would you take to make sure your code runs well in production and in the future. Ok, this is a silly example, we know tic-tac-toe probably won't break on us. But imagine if the board were 17x17, the rulebook 143 pages long and changing every year.
* would you approach it differently, with a tool that requires more setup but does the job better? If so, can you walk us through the solution in some bullet points and high level conceptual code? If not, can you explain to us why your solution beats other alternatives?
* what did you enjoy about the process of designing and implementing your solution? Is there anything you found frustrating?
